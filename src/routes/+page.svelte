            <p class="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Church of Christ preachers started as regular people sharing the gospel during the Restoration Movement, led by figures like Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone. Early on, they traveled and avoided fancy titles. After World War II, many churches hired full-time preachers, sparking debates—some still push for everyone to preach instead of relying on one person.

                The Church of Christ started with the Restoration Movement in America. They wanted to follow the New Testament way. Preachers back then were regular people sharing the gospel, not fancy clergy. It was simple, with no big titles or power setups.

                Early on, preachers traveled around. After World War II, many churches hired full-time guys to stay put. Some didn’t like that—they thought all capable men should take turns preaching. It’s still debated today.

                Church of Christ preachers come from New Testament roles like evangelists and ministers. Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone shaped it. Campbell began preaching in 1810 for free and got known for debates and writings in the <em>Christian Baptist</em> and <em>Millennial Harbinger</em>.

Stone kept it close to early church ways too.

                They avoided fancy clergy. Everyone was equal in sharing faith—no big ordination needed. Some preachers get “ordained” by elders just for marriage papers. It’s based on Bible roles like evangelists and teachers from Ephesians 4:11.

                Early preachers moved around a lot. Campbell and Stone did preaching tours. Some, like Austin McGary and David Lipscomb, didn’t want preachers stuck in one place full-time—especially in the 1880s. They thought everyone should preach. About 130 churches still do it that way, says the <a href="https://discipleshistory.org/wiki/churches-of-christ/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciples Historical Society<span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>.

                Things changed in the 20th century. Many churches got full-time preachers after World War II. Before that, it was a group effort. Daniel Sommer and Carl Ketcherside pushed for everyone to preach, not just one guy. It’s still a hot topic—check the <a href="https://discipleshistory.org/wiki/churches-of-christ/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciples Historical Society<span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>.

                David Lipscomb made waves too, especially in South Nashville. He liked small churches over big ones to keep everyone involved. He’d set up tent meetings with a preacher and tent to start new groups, helped by nearby churches. He used bi-vocational ministers—guys with day jobs who preached anyway. They didn’t need full pay, just faith and study. At South College Street Church (later Lindsley Avenue), they trained 9 or 10 of these working preachers in 18 years by 1906. It worked—Lipscomb built a network of small Nashville churches with everyday guys preaching, keeping it grassroots.
