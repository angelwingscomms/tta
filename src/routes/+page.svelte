                The Church of Christ came from something called the Restoration Movement in America. They wanted to get back to how things were done in the New Testament. Back then, preachers weren’t some fancy clergy group—they were just regular folks sharing the gospel. It was all about keeping things simple and avoiding big church titles and power structures.

                At first, preachers were travelers, moving from place to place. But after World War II, a lot of churches started hiring guys to stick around full-time. Not everyone liked that idea—some folks thought every capable guy in the church should take turns preaching. It’s still a hot topic for some.

                The preacher gig in the Church of Christ goes back to how they saw things in the New Testament—like evangelists and ministers. Big names like Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone helped shape it. Campbell kicked things off in 1810, preaching without pay, and got famous for his debates and writings in stuff like the <em>Christian Baptist</em> and <em>Millennial Harbinger</em>. You can read more about him <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Campbell-American-clergyman" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>. Stone was all about keeping it real to the early church vibes too.

                They didn’t want a fancy clergy setup. Everyone was supposed to be equal in sharing the faith—that’s why there’s no big ordination ceremony. Some preachers only get “ordained” by elders to sign marriage papers for the state. It’s all based on roles like evangelists and teachers from Ephesians 4:11 in the Bible.

                Way back, preachers were on the move, hitting up different churches. Campbell and Stone did a ton of these preaching tours. Some folks, like Austin McGary and David Lipscomb, didn’t love the idea of a preacher settling down in one spot full-time—especially around the 1880s. They wanted everyone to pitch in with preaching. Even now, about 130 churches stick to that old-school way, according to the <a href="https://discipleshistory.org/wiki/churches-of-christ/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciples Historical Society<span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>.

                Things really shifted in the 20th century. Some churches didn’t have full-time preachers until after World War II. Before that, it was more of a group effort. Guys like Daniel Sommer and Carl Ketcherside pushed hard for everyone to preach, not just one hired person. It’s still a debate that fires people up, and you can dig into it more at the <a href="https://discipleshistory.org/wiki/churches-of-christ/" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciples Historical Society<span class="sr-only">(opens in new tab)</span></a>.

                Here’s a quick rundown of how David Lipscomb shook things up too: He was a big deal in the Churches of Christ, especially around South Nashville. Lipscomb liked the idea of lots of small churches instead of a few big ones—kept everyone involved and let local talent shine. He’d set up tent meetings where a preacher and a tent would kick off a new group, with help from nearby churches at first. He leaned on guys who had day jobs but still preached—called bi-vocational ministers. They didn’t need full church pay, just a strong faith and some study time. Take the South College Street Church (later Lindsley Avenue)—by 1906, they’d trained 9 or 10 of these working preachers in 18 years. It worked! Lipscomb’s plan built a tight web of churches in Nashville with relatable, everyday guys preaching, making the whole thing feel grassroots and real.
