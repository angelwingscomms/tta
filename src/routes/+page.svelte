            The Preacher Problem: Christians Gotta Hash Out Truth Together
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Churches today hype up preachers like they’re the final say on scripture—interpretations, applications, all of it. It’s crap. We should figure it out ourselves, not kiss the ring of some self-important dude. A preacher’s just one of many God’s gifted to teach, not the boss.

            No Solo Acts
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Church needs multiple teachers—folks God’s juiced up to explain scripture. Could be anyone. Bible says we’ve all got different gifts:

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-3 italic text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
            “Gifts, different... prophecy... teaching... exhorting... sharing... leading... kindness...” — Romans 12:6-8 (YLT)
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mb-2">
            We should wrestle with scripture together—Acts 19:9 (YLT) says Paul “reasoned every day” with disciples. Not preached at, reasoned with. That’s what we’re missing.

            “The Preacher” Scam
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Now? Confusion hits, they say, “Preacher’ll sort it.” He talks, Q&A, done—his word’s law. Lame. “Ordained preacher”? Bible’s got no such thing. Timothy, Titus? Paul’s guys, not today’s showboats.

            Cash Grab
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Check this: Church of Christ in Abuja pays their “preacher” 150k naira/month (1.8m/year), plus 450k rent/month—2.25m total, or ~43k/week. Weekly take? 27k. They guilt-trip members to give more when someone’s broke, but that purse? Untouchable. Extortion. Sunday’s “for the saints” line? It’s for one saint—the “preacher.” Scam. They’re even planning an “elevated pulpit” seminar. Laughable.

            Bible Way or Bust
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Forget fancy pulpits. We need discussion, Christians digging into truth ourselves—not some Bible school grad barking orders. Follow God, not man. G.O.s suck, and preachers are copying them. Acts 20:7 (YLT): “Disciples gathered... to break bread, Paul discoursed... till midnight.” No pedestal—just talk. House-to-house like that? No admin BS.
